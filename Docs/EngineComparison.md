GAMES 4900: Fundamentals of Game Engine

January 31th, 2026



Unreal:

I felt that Unreal was the most difficult to use. The program ran slowly on my computer and generally didn’t feel nice to use. While Unity and Unreal share similar layouts for people, Unity has a much better content bar.  Unreal UI layout feels extremely cramped compared to unity and I feel like that hinders the user experience. In addition the content bar felt extremely finicky to use. Me trying to access content from the content bar would sometimes disappear. The biggest difference with Unity is the initial sample level. The sample level has a prebuilt landscape that is designed. Personally, I do not like this because it is an additional bloat to the level. I feel like Unreal also has the most complicated instance creator. For one to build an actor, a user needs to access multiple different screens to reach the actor creator. I personally don’t like this system.



Unity:

Unity was comparatively easy to use. Everything felt fair and easy to use within Unity the program. In addition the biggest similarity is between how Unity and Godot have their 3d space exists with a void. The major difference that Unity has over the two other engines was the ease of making a prefab asset. The user is able to just create a prefab in the current level and then they just drag into the content bar. This is frankly my favorite way of making instances.



Godot:

Godot is the most different of all the engines. Everything is different, but makes a lot of sense and is easy to use. The biggest similarity is that Godot’s packed scenes and Unreal’s Blueprint Actors are both created in different scenes. Though I prefer Godot’s because it requires less clicks overall and an user is able to jump from the main level directly into a packed scene
